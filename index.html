               <h2>JavaScript-Basics</h2>
               <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented Scripting language. JavaScript is extremely popular for a variety of reasons.
                    It is a small and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developers to take it in a bunch of different direcctions. 
                    javaScript lives inside a host environment (a web browser or Nood server), it can be connected to the objects of these environments
                    to provide programmatic control over them.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><p><a href="#">Variable Declaration</a> JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values - imagine a cup you fill 
                    with coffee, the cup holds the coffee, a variable holds a value. All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names. 
                    These unique names are called identifiers. <span class="color2">var x;</span></p></li>
                    <li><p><a href="#">Variable Assignment</a> Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables - our cup can now have the 
                    coffee poured in it, giving our variable a value to hold. The = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable. <span class ="color2">var x = 10;</span></p></li>
                    <li><p><a href="#">Data Type</a> Data types are an important concept; to be able to operate on variables you need to know the data types.
                    There are six data types that are JavaScript primitives: Boolean - <span class="color2">true</span> or <span class="color2">false;</span> null - <span class="color2">null</span> 
                    aka nothing; Numbers <span class="color2">-42</span> or <span class="color2">3.14159;</span> String - <span class="color2">"Coding Dojo Rocks!";</span> 
                    Array - <span class="color2">[1, 'Coding'</span>, <span class="color2">'Dojo'];</span> and Object - <span class="color2">{first-name: 'Jane'; last_name: 'Doe'}</span></p></li>
                    <li><p><a href="#">Conditions</a> When you write code, you want to perform different action for different decision -hitting different code blocks
                    based on values or conditions that have been met. You can see conditional statements in your code to accomplish this. There are the following condition
                    statements: <span class="color2">if</span> a specified condition is true, do this code in your code block; <span class="color2">else if</span> to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is 
                    false; <span class="color2">else</span> we execute this block of code;</p></li>
                    <li><p><a href="#">Loops</a> There are many different kind of loops in every programming language, but they all essentially do the same thing:
                    they will repeat an action some number of times. Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run around the track four time then you stop. That's a loop!</p></li>
                    <li><p><a href="#">Function</a> Functions are an encapsulation of code block.When we call our function this will run that ode block. Think of it as 
                    a list of instructions. As an example imagine we are puting together a desk from Ikea, we open up the instruction manual and get started, first we 
                    screw the legs to the table top; next, we plae the table the right way up. Done! We finished our instructions. Saedly there are a ton more tables to 
                    do so lets call our function over and over and over again.</p></li>
